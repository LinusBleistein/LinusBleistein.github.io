# Some small Python libraries to make your life easier 

When using Python, you may sometimes stumbles upon small difficulties or missing features 
(for instance, labeling array dimensions in Numpy, or adding color to text in the terminal) and think: "hey, has this been coded by anyone in a simple and elegant way ?". 
I've listed bellow some easy-to-use and simple libraries which will make your life easier. 
If you're a skilled Python programmer, you might know them already - but if you're starting, they might come in handy.
Enjoy, and feel free to suggest any other library !

### XlsxWriter 

[XlsxWriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/index.html) is a Python library that allows to create and modify Excel files directly in Python. For instance, you can use XlsxWriter to save multiple Pandas dataframes as different sheets in a single xls file, set the width of some columns, change a few values and plot a simple barchart directly from a Jupyter notebook.
