## Research interests

I work on causality and time series analysis for health data. The goal of my research is to piece together four big topics that are of interest to mathematicians, biostatisticians, MDs, economists (and many more): 
1. [Causal inference](/causality.html).
2. [High dimensional statistics](/highdim.html).
3. [Survival analysis](/survival.html).
4. [Time series and longitudinal data](/ts.html). 

Check out the links for short introductions to each of these topics and suggested readings. 

I am also more broadly interested in rough analysis, optimization, reinforcement learning and theoretical machine learning.  

## Bio

I was born in Celle (Germany) and studied in Paris and Freibourg at the French-German Highschool. In 2016, after 3 years of classe préparatoire BL (mathematics, social sciences and humanities), I was accepted with full scholarship at Ecole Normale Supérieure (Paris), where I first studied economics before turning to mathematics, computer science and machine learning. I graduated from ENS Ulm in fall 2021. 

I hold a BSc in economics and in mathematics from ENS Ulm, and a Master degree in [control, optimisation and calculus of variations](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/MathModel/presentation/cocv.html) from Sorbonne University (form. Université Paris 6 - UPMC). Check out my CV for further details.

## Teaching and other academic activities 

- 2021: Python 101, [M2 Massive Data in Healthcare](https://odf.u-paris.fr/fr/offre-de-formation/master-XB/sciences-technologies-sante-STS/sante-publique-K2NDGZO3/master-sante-publique-parcours-donnees-massives-en-sante-K168SJQL.html) (9 hours).
- 2021: Survival Analysis with Longitudinal Data, [M2 Massive Data in Healthcare](https://odf.u-paris.fr/fr/offre-de-formation/master-XB/sciences-technologies-sante-STS/sante-publique-K2NDGZO3/master-sante-publique-parcours-donnees-massives-en-sante-K168SJQL.html) (6 hours). Documents for this class can be found [here](https://github.com/LinusBleistein/DMS_longitudinal).

- With Pierre Marion, Jules Bonnard, Gauthier Tallec and Yves Vinec, I organized [Neurips@Paris 2022](https://neuripsinparis.github.io/neurips2022paris/), a two-day in person event in Paris for researchers in machine learning. We were fortunate to be supported by Apple, Google, Criteo and Owkin. We are looking for motivated students to help us organize next year's session: please contact me if your are interrested.    
- With fellow lab colleagues (Pierre Clavier and Agathe Senellart), I co-founded and currently organize the JSAIDH (Junior Seminar Artificial Intelligence and Digital Healthcare), a monthly junior seminar for young researchers from all labs working on AI and healthcare. More information can be found on our [website](https://seminairedoctorantcrc.github.io/aboutme/). 
- With [Martin Dumont](https://www.aphp.fr/connaitre-lap-hp/recherche-innovation/nos-chaires-de-recherche/philosophie-lhopital-la-chaire), I co-organize an internship program called _Normaliens à l'Hôtel Dieu_, which allows a selected group of ENS students to intern in a parisian hospital. Students also get to meet researches and MDs and to visit different research units of AP-HP. It mainly targets non scientific students, but science students may also apply. If you're a student at ENS Ulm and would like to join the program, feel free to reach out. 

## Misc. 

- For my bachelor thesis at ENS Ulm, I worked on mixing time of markov chains with Linus Rösler and Dowan Koo under the supervision of [Claire Boyer](http://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/boyer/) and [Anna Ben-Hamou](http://www.lpsm.paris/dw/doku.php?id=users:benhamou:index). The manuscript is available [here](assets/pdfs/licence.pdf). 
- My master thesis is about the signature transform and Wasserstein-GANs. I was supervised by [Adeline Fermanian](https://afermanian.github.io/), [Claire Boyer](http://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/boyer/) and [Gérard Biau](https://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/biau/). The manuscript is [here](assets/pdfs/memoireM2.pdf).  
- [Introducing features to the group testing model to improve signal reconstruction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinusBleistein/Group-testing-with-knowledge/43be5b81f9efd0a68302d0675cee431c08f30211/Group%20Testing%20Linus%20Bleistein.pdf) - a small three month project for the class Computational Optimal Transport (Master MVA) by Gabriel Peyré.    

## More about me 

I'm fluent in German, French and English. I love to hike, climb, cycle and enjoy the outdoors (as almost all people doing research).
