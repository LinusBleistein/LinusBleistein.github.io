## About

I'm a first year Ph.D. candidate @ Inria Paris (HeKa Team) and Université Paris-Sacly under the supervision of Agathe Guilloux and Anne-Sophie Jannot. 

## Research interests

My research deals with causal inference for high dimensional longitudinal survival data. I'm also broadly interested in time series (especially discrete time series), epidemiology, optimization and optimal transport. 

## Bio

I'm expected to graduate from Ecole Normale Supérieure Ulm in fall 2021 in mathematics, computer science and economics. I hold a BSc in economics and in mathematics from ENS Ulm, and a Master degree in [control, optimisation and calculus of variations](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/MathModel/presentation/cocv.html) from Sorbonne University (form. Université Paris 6 - UPMC). Check out my CV for further details.
