I'm a first year Ph.D. candidate @ Inria Paris (HeKa Team) and Universit√© Paris-Sacly under the supervision of Agathe Guilloux and Anne-Sophie Jannot. My main research interests are causal inference, time series analysis (both discrete and continuous), high dimensional statistics and survival analysis.
