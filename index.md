## About

I'm a first year Ph.D. candidate @ [Inria Paris in the HeKa Team](https://team.inria.fr/heka/fr/) and Université Paris-Sacly under the supervision of [Agathe Guilloux](http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/members/aguilloux/welcome) and [Anne-Sophie Jannot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-sophie-jannot-a2286ba1/). 

## Research interests

My research tries to piece together four big topics that are of interest to mathematicians, biostatisticians, MDs, economists (and many more): 
1. [Causal inference](/causality.html).
2. [High dimensional statistics](/highdim.html).
3. [Survival analysis](/survival.html).
4. [Time series and longitudinal data](/ts.html). 

Check out the links for short introductions to each of these topics and suggested readings. 

## Bio

I'm expected to graduate from Ecole Normale Supérieure Ulm in fall 2021 in mathematics, computer science and economics. 

I hold a BSc in economics and in mathematics from ENS Ulm, and a Master degree in [control, optimisation and calculus of variations](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/MathModel/presentation/cocv.html) from Sorbonne University (form. Université Paris 6 - UPMC). Check out my CV for further details.

## Contact
